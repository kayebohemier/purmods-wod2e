        <h1>Purified in the God-Machine Chronicle</h1>
        <p> A Short Work Describing Modifications to the Core Immortals Text, with New Integrity, Siddhi, Merit, and Other Suggestions Based On a Host of Conversations in Which the Authors Draw Care and Attention to the Unique Spirit-Like Status of Purified and Its Mechanical Effects and Divert the Reader with Marginalia</p>

<p>This short document is the HTML version of a PDF that proposes modifications to the Purified as detailed in the <em>Immortals</em> book, part of the World of Darkness mechanical system. (And I suggest checking out the PDF: We have some hilarious marginalia that are not in this version.) The mechanical modifications are based on mechanics from the God-Machine Chronicle Purified port discussion on the Onyx Path Forums, along with some of the changes implemented for Purified in an IRC-based World of Darkness campaign called Original Sin. In both cases, modifications to Purified have made them more consistent mechanically with other spirit-based templates, such as Uratha, Claimed, and spirits themselves. Purified are hands-down my favorite supe type in the World of Darkness, with Mage and Changeling vying for second place.</p>

<p>While this mechanical adaptation draws from those two sources, it also includes Conditions, a new Morality scale, and a lot of flavor text based on philosophical discussions and ruminations on what the Purified are with Onyx Path user callishka. callishka made substantive intellectual contributions --- he suggested excellent additions to the Purified Slang section, wrote some of the Merits, advocated for the rights of Outer Path Purified, ported relevant Mage Rotes as Numina, wrote a few of the Mystery Cults, and grounded a lot of the flow state-induced mechanical insanity in reality.</p>

<p>This document does <em>not</em> replace the core text for <em>Immortals</em>. This text frequently refers to mechanics available in that book, in the <em>Book of Spirits</em>, and in the core books for the World of Darkness.</p>

<p>Hi, folks. Purified are one of my favorite playable creatures from any game system, right up there with Kindred and Wraiths, so when Kaye showed me the first fifty or so pages of this document, I jumped at the chance to consult and add some touches here and there. We have a blast playing Purified in 2nd Edition World of Darkness, and I hope you do, too. If you want my advice, I say, get some friends together, roll up nothing but Purified (with maybe one of those lesser Immortals such as David Hill's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X_eASK_Zmfa9rvbrw0RR56iHvVNSCEoxOqTDiQWnWyY/edit?usp=sharing">Psychic Vampires</a> or Kindred to round things out), create a lineage mystery cult for your characters, and go nuts roleplaying spirit-person drama. And make sure your campaign includes talking trash about Uratha at every available opportunity.</p>
